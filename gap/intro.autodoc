@Chapter Usage of the package

@Section Introduction

The &GAP; package <Package>labelface</Package> provides a low level 
interface to the software <URL Text="bliss: A Tool for Computing 
Automorphism Groups and Canonical Labelings of 
Graphs">http://www.tcs.hut.fi/Software/bliss/</URL>, 
written by Tommi Junttila and Petteri Kaski <Cite Key="Bliss:2007" />. 

The only interest of this package is the computation of the group 
of colour preserving automorphisms of coloured graphs. The graphs 
can be directed or undirected, bipartite or not. Duplicate edges 
between vertices are ignored but try to avoid introducing them in 
the first place as they are not ignored immediately but will 
consume memory and computation resources for a while.

For more specialized algorithms and methods of the theory of graphs,
we recommend the packages <Package>Digraphs</Package> <Cite 
Key="Digraphs0.15.2" /> and <Package>GRAPE</Package> <Cite 
Key="GRAPE4.8.2" />. 
To compute graph automorphisms see also the software  <URL Text="nauty">
http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/nauty/</URL> by Brendan McKay and Adolfo 
Piperno <Cite Key="Nauty:2014" />.

@Section Installation

- Download the package from <URL>https://github.com/gap-packages/labelface</URL>.
- Unzip/untar the file, this should create a directory called <F>labelface*</F>.
- Locate the <F>pkg</F> directory of your &GAP; directory, which contains the 
  directories <F>lib</F>, <F>doc</F> and so on. Move the directory 
  <F>labelface*</F> into the <F>pkg</F> directory.
- Alternatively, you can use your <F>pkg</F> directory. Make sure it is in your 
  &GAP; root path.
- It is necessary to compile the &labelface; package. Inside the 
  <F>pkg/labelface*</F> directory, type
  <Listing>
  <![CDATA[./configure
  make]]></Listing>
- Start &GAP; in the usual way (i.e. type <C>gap</C> at the command line).
- Type <C>LoadPackage("blissinterface");</C>
- For questions, remarks and issues please use the 
  <URL Text="issue tracker">https://github.com/gap-packages/labelface/issues</URL>.
