  [33X[0;0YThis  section  will describe the funtions of [5Xglabella[105X, and their nonchecking
  counterparts.[133X
  
  
  [1X2.1 [33X[0;0YTheory[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YLet  [23X\Gamma[123X  be  a  graph  on  the  set [23X\{1,\ldots,n\}[123X of vertices. [23XG[123X may be
  directed  or  not; loops and duplicate edges are ignored. The graph is given
  by  the  list  of  its  adjacencies  [23XN_1,\ldots,N_n[123X, where [23XN_i[123X is the set of
  (out)neighbors  of the vertex [23Xi[123X. For an undirected simple graph, the list of
  adjacencies must be symmetric, that is, [23Xi \in N_j[123X if and only if [23Xj\in N_i[123X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YA  vertex  colouring  of  [23X\Gamma[123X  can be given in two different formats. The
  [13Xplain[113X  format  is a list [23Xc_1,\ldots,c_n[123X of integers; [23Xc_i[123X being the colour of
  the  vertex  [23Xi[123X.  The [13Xnauty[113X format consists of two lists: [23Xu_1,\ldots,u_n[123X is a
  permutation  of  [23X\{1,\ldots,n\}[123X,  and [23Xs_1,\ldots,s_n \in \{0,1\}[123X. The second
  list  indicates  the division of the vertices into colours: if [23Xs_i=0[123X, then a
  colour class ends at position [23Xi[123X. For example, the lists[133X
  
  
  [24X[33X[0;6Yu=[3,4,6,7,2,1,5,8,9], \quad s=[0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0][133X
  
  [124X
  
  [33X[0;0Yrepresent the colour classes [23X\{\{3\},\{4\},\{1,2,6,7\},\{5,8,9\}\}[123X. In plain
  format, the same colouring can be given by the list [23Xc=[1,1,2,3,4,1,1,4,4][123X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe   solver  programs  (recently  bliss  0.73,  nauty  2.7R1)  compute  the
  generators  of  the  automorphism  group  of  the  (coloured)  graph [23X\Gamma[123X.
  Moreover  a canonical labelling of [23X\Gamma[123X is computed; this is a permutation
  of  the  vertices  that  brings  the graph in a canonical format. Isomorphic
  graphs  in  canonical format are equal. Notice that canonical labellings can
  depend  on  the  solver used, the version of the solver, the version of this
  packages, the version of GAP, parameter settings of the solver, and possibly
  even the compiler and computer used.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  solver programs also compute a 32-bit hash value of the graph. The same
  as  above:  this  hash  value is an isomorphy invariant that depends on your
  software  and  hardware  environment.  It  also  depends on the colouring in
  bliss, but not in nauty.[133X

  [33X[0;0YOur suggestion is to use [13Xbliss[113X for directed graphs and [13XTraces[113X for undirected
  graphs. All solvers seem to perform better with undirected graphs.[133X
  
  [8Xbliss[108X
        [33X[0;6YVery  efficient  solver,  written in C++. Works well for both directed
        and undirected graphs.[133X

        recommended for small graphs.[133X
  
  [8Xnauty sparse graphs[108X
        [33X[0;6YWritten  in  C.  Works  for  both  directed and undirected graphs. Not
        recommended for large graphs with few automorphisms.[133X
  
  [8XTraces[108X
        [33X[0;6YVery  efficient  solver,  written  in  C. It only works for undirected
